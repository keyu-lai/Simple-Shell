1.13 The issue of resource utilization shows up in different forms in different types of operating systems. List what resources must be managed carefully in the following settings:a. Mainframe or minicomputer systemsb. Workstations connected to serversc. Mobile computers

a. CPU time, memory and I/O.
b. networking and servers, including file, compute, and print servers.
c. Power, CPU time, memory

1.19 What is the purpose of interrupts? How does an interrupt differ from a trap? Can traps be generated intentionally by a user program? If so, for what purpose?

The purpose of interrupt is to signal the occurrence of an event and transfer execution to appropriate interrupt service routine. Interrupt is generated by hardware, while trap is generated by software. Trap can be generated intentionally by a user program. They may want to request some operating-system services.

1.21 Some computer systems do not provide a privileged mode of operation in hardware. Is it possible to construct a secure operating system for these computer systems? Give arguments both that it is and that it is not possible.

It is possible: This can be achieved by software. The programming should do some security checking that the hardware miss, and build it into the software.
It¡¯s not possible: The computer designate some machine potentially harmful instructions as privileged instructions and allow them to be executed only in privileged mode. Without the existence of privileged mode, we can not accomplish this protection. For example, a user program may wipe out the operating system, or multiple programs can write to a device at the same time.

1. 29 Describe some of the challenges of designing operating systems for mobile devices compared with designing operating systems for traditional PCs.

a. Compared with laptop computers, The memory capacity and processing speed of mobile devices are more limited.
b. It should support some services unique to mobile devices, such as GPS, accelerometers and gyroscopes. 
c. They don¡¯t have physical mouse and keyboard, and we should feature a touch screen for user interaction.
d. The power consumption is a big concern that we should not overlook.
e. As for processor, they use processor that are smaller, slower and have fewer processing cores.

2.13 Describe three general methods for passing parameters to the operating system.

a. Parameters are passed in registers.
b. Parameters are stored in a block or table in memory, and the address of the block is passed in a register.
c. Parameters can be placed or pushed, onto the stack by the program and popped off the stack by the operating system.

2.16 What are the advantages and disadvantages of using the same system-call interface for manipulating both files and devices?



2.23 How are iOS and Android similar? How are they different?
Difference: iOS is designed to run solely on Apple mobile devices and is close-sourced, while Android is designed to run on multiple mobile platforms and is open-sourced.
Similarity: They are both operating system for mobile platform. Their structures are similar, a layered stack of software that provides a set of frameworks for developing mobile applications.

2.24 Explain why Java programs running on Android systems do not use the standard Java API and virtual machine.

Because they are designed for traditional computer system. The Java API and virtual machine that Android uses is optimized for mobile devices with limited memory and CPU processing capabilities.
